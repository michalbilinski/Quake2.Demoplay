# Quake2 Demoplay by neveride

## How to use the application
Windows application that allows users to start Quake 2 demos by double clicking them in Windows.

To configure the app, just start it and set the path to your Quake 2 executable. You may also configure the fast forward, slow motion and pause buttons that will work during the demo preview. After the setup is done, close the app. Save the configuration when asked to keep the settings for the next time.

After that just double click on a *.dm2 file, choose "Open with ...", point to the application executable and check the checkbox "Always use this application to open *.dm2 files".

Enjoy!
